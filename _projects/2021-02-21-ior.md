## Internet of Robots
This is my sandbox. My inventions and makes that made it through doodling. Some are useful, while others are just me playing around with existing builds.

This is about making and experimenting. About playing and testing, remixing and inventing new stuff - no matter how it happened to come into my workshop. I find great inspiration in the work of others. Sharing knowledge and design is an incredible combination which is the reason I named my site "internet of robots".
