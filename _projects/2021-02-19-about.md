## srosendal
My name is Sikker. I am a mechanical engineer from Denmark that enjoys making stuff and inventing new projects. I very often have too many sideprojects going on.

* Maker
* Investor
* Works with GitHub Pages
* Updated and supported by the developers

When at home, I keep inventing in my workshop, making useless and sometimes useful stuff - but usually these inventions can fit onto a desk.

I am trying to reach financial freedom in 8 years. And I am sharing my findings here. Because financial freedom is not only about money, it is about a lifestyle, investing and philosophy. 

### About my page
These sites are all about making and experimenting. About playing and testing. Learning and remixing new stuff with the old - no matter how it happened I also find great inspiration in the work of others. Sharing knowledge and design is an incredible combination and I hope you find something here as well.
