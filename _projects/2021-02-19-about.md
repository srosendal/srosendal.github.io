## Internet of Robots
My name is Sikker. I am a mechanical engineer from Denmark that enjoys making stuff and inventing new projects. I very often have too many sideprojects going on.

My drive is working with new types of innovation. From the early disrupting ideas, making them come alive into useful products. I have been involved in projects involving small locking mechanisms, to heavy automated machinery, to the inventions of new materials. I have done simulation of orbitating gears and airflow around mite-dispersing quadcopters. I've been working with consulting tasks, designing products for some of the largest companies in Denmark to the small private inventors. Universities and research institutions such as MAXLAB and CERN particle research.

No matter the task, my ultimate goal is always to ensure projects gets realised - from the first ideas into real products. I can not really share work-related projects here, but you can visit my profile at [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sikkerrosendal/)

When at home, I keep inventing in my workshop, making useless and sometimes useful stuff - but usually these inventions can fit onto a desk.

In my workshop there is a [3D printer](/inventor/printer/), [micro CNC](/inventor/microcnc/), electronic equipment, [sensors](/stream/pressure/) and [microcontrollers](/inventor/motionsensor/) - all because I love making and combining stuff. Using Mechanics, Electronics and Programming I can create useful [machinery](/inventor/cnc/), [weird robots](/inventor/robocleaner/) or maybe new [inventions](/inventor/bitcoinbox/). Science and DIY projects is a great combination - combined with sharing power of the internet - then it gets really great!

I am trying to reach financial freedom in 8 years. And I am sharing my findings here. Because financial freedom is not only about money, it is about a lifestyle, investing and philosophy. 

These sites are about making and experimenting. About playing and testing. Learning and remixing new stuff - no matter how it happened I also find great inspiration in the work of others. Sharing knowledge and design is an incredible combination and I hope you find something here as well.
